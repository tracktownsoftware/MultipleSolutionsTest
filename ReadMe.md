### MultipleSolutionsTest

This is a test for maintaining code in a large repository which is then copied into smaller targeted public repositories for sharing.

MultipleSolutionsTest is a large repository containing .Net Web and Windows solutions and a shared class library project. A script copies the appropriate content into smaller repositories named MultipleSolutionsTest_Web and MultipleSolutionsTest_Windows.

In a cmd window clone the following repos into the same parent folder: <br>
```
cd c:\temp\myrepos
git clone https://github.com/tracktownsoftware/MultipleSolutionsTest
git clone https://github.com/tracktownsoftware/MultipleSolutionsTest_Windows
git clone https://github.com/tracktownsoftware/MultipleSolutionsTest_Web
```

Use VisualStudio or VSCode to make changes in the large local repository MultipleSolutionsTest. 

Run MultipleSolutionsTest\CopyToSmallRepos\copyToSmallRepos.bat to copy your changes to the smaller local repos MultipleSolutionsTest_Web and MultipleSolutionsTest_Windows.
